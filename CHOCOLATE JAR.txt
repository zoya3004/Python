#You are given an integer array of size n,representing jars of chocolate.Three Students A,B and C respectively,will
#pick chocolates one by one from each chocolate jar,till the jar is empty,and then repeat the same with the rest of the jars.
#Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the total number of chocolates that student A will have,
#after all the chocolates have been picked from all the jars.
#Note:Once a jar is done A will start taking the chocolates from the new jar.
#Input1:An integer array representing the quality of chocolates in each jar.
#input2:An integer value N representing the number of jars
